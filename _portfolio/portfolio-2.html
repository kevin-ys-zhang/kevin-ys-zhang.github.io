title: "Ensemble and Metapolicy Approaches to Robotic Behavior Cloning"
excerpt: "Advisor: Professor Zachary Kingston<br /> In this project, I hope to extend the generalization properties of the <a href="https://mihdalal.github.io/neuralmotionplanner/">NeuralMP</a> approach. My goal is to make use of ensemble Mixture of Experts approach to optimize as a metapolicy such that the combination of experts may generalize better ot unseen environments. Through my current progress, I have been able to implement modified versions of previous works' approaches in training and architecture, and improve the process by which I udnerstand the content of related work."
