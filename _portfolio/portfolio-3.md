title: "ML@Purdue Project: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Pokemon Battling"
excerpt: "Here, I am leading a project to teach new members about reinforcement learning in a novel environment- Pokemon Battling. I hope to tackle an extension to my previous report, and support a team in developing multiple methods for training of an agent for competitive Pokemon battling. In particular, I hope to focus efforts on development of effective methods in few-shot learning or imitation learning. Current progress is focused on training members in RL techniques and familarizing them with PyTorch and OpenAI Gym; as well as associated other libraries used to simulate and connect Pokemon Battling to these systems. The final aim is to host a competition for the final trained agents to showcase the team's efforts."
