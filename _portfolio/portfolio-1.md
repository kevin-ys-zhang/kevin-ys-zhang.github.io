title: "Foundational LLMs for Decompiled Code"
excerpt: "<b>Advisors:</b> Professor [Lin Tan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/lintan/), PhD students Nan Jiang and Danning Xie.<br/><br/>In this project, we aim to develop a foundational model for use in refinement of the output of decompilers. Previous state-of-the-art approach [LLM4Decompile](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05286) is trained only on output of the Ghidra SRE tool, and we hope to build on the generalization capabilities of the model for use with output of the Hex-Rays decompiler accessed through IDA Pro. I am thus aiming to explore efficient self-supervised methods and architectural adjustments for finetuning of their released model. Gathering and decompiling code from Github repositories has been a major bottleneck in this project, combined with slow training of very large models, further indicating to me the importance of model and data efficient approaches."
