title: "Ensemble and Metapolicy Approaches to Robotic Behavior Cloning"
excerpt: "<b>Advisor:</b> Professor [Zachary Kingston](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/zkingsto.html)<br/><br/>In this project, I hope to extend the generalization properties of the [NeuralMP](https://mihdalal.github.io/neuralmotionplanner/) approach. My goal is to make use of an ensemble Mixture of Experts approach to optimize a metapolicy such that the combination of experts may generalize better to unseen environments. Through my current progress, I have been able to implement modified versions of previous works' approaches in training and architecture, and improve the process by which I udnerstand the content of related work."
