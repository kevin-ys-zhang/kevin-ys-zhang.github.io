title: "Maximum Independent Set Inspired Dataset Reduction with Neutral Atom Quantum Computers"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'Quantum computers have gained popularity in recent years due to their potential to solve problems currently difficult for classical computers to tackle.
This paper demonstrates a potential use case for analog quantum computers, based on the neutral atom architecture, for dataset reduction in machine learning.
Our approach, which uses a graph representation of the dataset, is inspired by a Quantum Maximum Independent Set (QMIS) approach and combines classical and quantum computing approaches to select a representative subset of data points.
We compare our approach with classical dataset reduction techniques-k-means clustering and classical MIS on various datasets and models.
Our results then show that models trained on datasets reduced with our method achieve similar to better results in terms of F-1 score, particularly in complex datasets.
These results indicate the potential of neutral atom quantum computing platforms to enhance machine learning workflows through effective dataset reduction.'
