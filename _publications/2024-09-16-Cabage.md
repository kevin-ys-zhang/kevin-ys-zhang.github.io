excerpt: ' Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is often provided as
 a pay-per-query, black-box system to clients. Such a black-box approach
 not only hinders open replication, validation, and interpretation of model
 results, but also makes it harder for white-hat researchers to identify vul
nerabilities in the MLaaS systems. Model extraction is a promising tech
nique to address these challenges by reverse-engineering black-box mod
els. Since training data is typically unavailable for MLaaS models, this
 paper focuses on the realistic version of it: data-free model extraction.
 We propose a data-free model extraction approach, CaBaGE, to achieve
 higher model extraction accuracy with a small number of queries. Our
 innovations include (1) a novel experience replay for focusing on difficult
 training samples; (2) an ensemble of generators for steadily producing
 diverse synthetic data; and (3) a selective filtering process for querying
 the victim model with harder, more balanced samples. In addition, we
 create a more realistic setting, for the first time, where the attacker has
 no knowledge of the number of classes in the victim training data, and
 create a solution to learn the number of classes on the fly. Our evaluation
 shows that CaBaGE outperforms existing techniques on seven datasets—
 MNIST,FMNIST,SVHN,CIFAR-10,CIFAR-100,ImageNet-subset, and
 Tiny ImageNet—with an accuracy improvement of the extracted models
 by up to 43.13%. Furthermore, the number of queries required to extract
 a clone model matching the final accuracy of prior work is reduced by
 up to 75.7%.'
