 Games have long been seen as a test for skill and adaptation, for both humans and artificial algorithms. They vary
 widely in rule systems and complexity and can serve as
 test-beds for development of new algorithms. One such
 game, popular with a wide variety of demographics all over
 the world, is Pokemonâ€“ and more specifically, its system
 of battling. This project is inspired by recent interest in develop
ing machine learning systems for Pokemon battling, and
 was carried out with the aim of building experience in
 Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to accomplish
 such a goal. Different algorithms in RL are analyzed,
 then implemented in PyTorch. The agents are trained and
 tested in a Pokemon Battling environment which has been
 integrated into an OpenAI Gym environment.
