excerpt: ' Games have long been seen as a test for skill and adapta
tion, for both humans and artificial algorithms. They vary
 widely in rule systems and complexity and can serve as
 test-beds for development of new algorithms. One such
 game, popular with a wide variety of demographics all over
 the world, is Pok´ emon– and more specifically, its system
 of battling. This project is inspired by recent interest in develop
ing machine learning systems for Pok´ emon battling, and
 was carried out with the aim of building experience in
 Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to accomplish
 such a goal. Different algorithms in RL are analyzed,
 then implemented in PyTorch. The agents are trained and
 tested in a Pok´emon Battling environment which has been
 integrated into an OpenAI Gym environment.'
