excerpt: ' Fixing bugs in code is a time-consuming endeavor. Automatic Program Repair (APR) seeks to autonomously fix bugs present in source code through patch generation. Recently, the application of neural networks and deep learning techniques, including neural machine translation, to this field has yielded good results, achieving state-of-the-art rates for fixes on the Defects4j and QuixBugs benchmarks. Ensemble techniques have been used to improve the learning properties of these models and achieve better results. However, a systematic measurement of the effectiveness of different ensemble methods has not been carried out. Partitioning of the dataset for training with bagging was selected as a simple and comparable ensemble method. Clustering of the bug type via human categorization and clustering via the encoder hidden state output of a pre-trained model were compared with random divisions to split the training data for ensemble models. This study then compared the results of these different ensemble methods with the same model design on the QuixBugs benchmark to determine their relative effectiveness. It was found that models trained on randomly partitioned data outperformed models trained on data clustered by both human categorization and machine embeddings, fixing 25 bugs on the QuixBugs benchmark as compared to 20 each for the two clustering methods. Further conclusions and observations about the performance of each approach, as well as recommendations for further approaches in ensemble techniques will be provided based on the comparison and analysis of results for these methods.'
