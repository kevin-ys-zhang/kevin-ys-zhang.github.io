title: "Towards Quantum AdaBoost Weight Initialization"
collection: publications
category: conferences
excerpt: 'Quantum preprocessing has the potential to improve traditional machine learning pipelines, where classically, there may be limited options.
Boosting algorithms such as Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) are widely used in machine learning to enhance model accuracy by iteratively adjusting the weights of weak classifiers and training data to focus on misclassified samples.
This paper introduces a quantum-inspired approach to data weight initialization in AdaBoost.
We implement and test this quantum-inspired initialization on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its impact on the convergence of the AdaBoost classifier.
Our findings suggest that quantum-inspired weight initialization has the potential to improve the performance of boosting algorithms by offering a weight distribution which encodes data uniqueness from the outset.
While acknowledging current quantum hardware limitations and the need for further research, we highlight the potential of quantum preprocessing in classical machine learning pipelines, offering enhancements where classical methods lack suitable alternatives.
This approach demonstrates potential in quantum software engineering by introducing augmentation steps that integrate quantum computing within classical algorithms.'
